<p><strong>Gotta’ Have Money to Make Money? Bargaining Behavior and Financial Need of Microentrepreneurs</strong> (with Morgan Hardy and Lena Song) <em> American Economic Review: Insights. </em> January 2022; 4.1: 1 – 17 
<br>

<p>

<div id="gotta" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2"><small> Bargaining over real prices with microenterprise owners in Ghana, we show that sellers with less per capita household liquidity agree to lower sale prices. This relationship is robust across firms and within firms over time, even after controlling for a plethora of time-varying observables. A computerized bargaining experiment, with randomized initial payout sizes, corroborates the real-bargaining findings. This pattern can be explained by an application of classical bargaining theory that includes endowments and utility functions with decreasing absolute risk aversion. The potential poverty-multiplying implications of pricing behavior is a key frontier in understanding barriers to the profitability of microenterprises.</small><br><br></div>


<p><strong>Thirty-five years later: Long-term effects of the Matlab Maternal and Child Health/Family Planning Program on older women’s well-being</strong> (with Tania Barham, Andrew Foster, Chris Jochem, Jane Menken, Abdur Razzaque, Elisabeth Root, and Patrick Turner) <em> Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. </em> 2021; 118, no. 28

<p>

<div id="thirtyfive" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2"><small>Few studies have addressed links between family planning programs and long-term benefits for women’s health and economic outcomes, especially in societies where old-age support and women’s status are tied to childbearing and where smaller families may carry negative consequences for women. We analyzed the maternal and child health/family planning (MCH/FP) program, a highly effective intervention introduced in the rural Matlab subdistrict of Bangladesh in 1977 with a subsequent 12-y differential in service access. We found significant differences in lifetime contraceptive behavior and completed fertility among women born 1938−1973. We found few effects on later health or economic outcomes except for an association of MCH/FP with poorer overall health and poorer metabolic health among women born 1950−1961.</small><br><br></div>


<p><strong>The market-reach of pandemics: Evidence from female workers in Ethiopia’s ready-made garment industry</strong> (with with Christian Johannes Meyer, Morgan Hardy, Marc Witte, and Eyoual Demeke). <em> World Development.</em> January 2021;137:105179.

<p>

<div id="mktreach" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2"><small> In a globalized world, pandemics transmit impacts through markets. We document employment changes, coping strategies, and welfare of garment factory workers in Ethiopia’s largest industrial park during the early stages of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. We field a phone survey of female workers during a two month period in which cases are rapidly rising globally, but not locally. Our data suggest significant changes in employment, high levels of migration away from urban areas to rural areas if women are no longer working, and high levels of food insecurity. These findings compel a research and policy focus on documenting and mitigating the market-reach of pandemics on low-income workers at the margins. </small><br><br></div>


<p><strong>It’s Getting Crowded in Here: Experimental Evidence of Demand Constraints in the Gender Profit Gap </strong> (with Morgan Hardy) <em> The Economic Journal. </em> October 2020; 130(631):2272-90.
<br>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('crowd')">Abstract</a> | <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ej/article-abstract/130/631/2272/5857998?login=false">Paper</a> | <a href="https://voxdev.org/topic/firms-trade/if-she-builds-it-they-won-t-come-gender-profit-gap">VoxDev</a>] </small>
<p>

<div id="crowd" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2"><small> This article considers market-level contributors to the well-documented gender profit gap among micro-entrepreneurs. We combine data from a garment-making firm census and market research survey in Ghana, uncovering a gender gap in the market-size-to-firm ratio and observing disproportionate self-reports of ‘not enough customers’ from female owners. We develop a simple model and discuss implications of potential gender differences in demand constraints. As experimental corroboration, we show that female-owned firms expand production and experience profit increases in response to random demand shocks, while male-owned firms do not. Nationally representative data echoes our experimental findings, showing more crowding in female-dominated industries.</small><br><br></div>



<p><strong> Mind The (Profit) Gap: Why Are Female Enterprise Owners Earning Less than Men? </strong> (with Morgan Hardy) <em> AEA Papers and Proceedings </em> May 2018, Vol. 108, pp. 252-55.
<br>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('mindgap')">Abstract</a> | <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20181025">Paper</a> ] </small>
<p>

<div id="mindgap" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2"><small> We explore potential causes for the well-documented profit gap between male- and female-owned microenterprises in low-income countries. We use rich data from an ongoing field project in Ghana's garment making sector, and our study sample consists of all garment making firms in a midsize district capital. Even within the same industry, male-owned firms earn nearly twice as much profit as female-owned firms. Furthermore, we find the large and persistent gender difference in profits cannot be explained by our extensive firm- and owner-level characteristics. We conclude that factors outside of individual firm or firm-owner characteristics are likely to be at play.</small><br><br></div>
