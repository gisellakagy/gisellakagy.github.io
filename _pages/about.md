I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Human Ecology at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. My research is in development economist with a focus on gender, employment in low-income countries, and the impact of early childhood and in-utero health shocks on later life health and human capital accumulation. I have projects in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Ghana that use a variety of experimental and applied methods with a particular focus on designing surveys and collecting new data. My work has been published in top general interest and development economics field journals. I received my PhD in economics from the University of Colorado Boulder in 2015.
